# Screen Space Reflection For Unity 6 And Unity 2022 [URP]

The project impl SSR shader that works on Unity 6 and Unity 2022.

It provide 3 methods to perform SSR tracing, mostly for my own references.
 - #### view space trace
   > (has oversampling and undersampling issue due to perspetive nature)
 - #### screen space trace
   > (based on Morgan McGuire's fast Screen Space Ray Tracing paper )
 - #### Hi-Z trace
   > (based on GPU Pro 5' SSR, also heavly modified from JoshuaLim007's impl, see references)

   > for rougher surface pixel, the Hi-Z method will fallback to use screen space trace, which imporves performance.


#### If TAA(or STP in Unity 6) is enabled, it will mixed the SSR result with previous frame. So it gives a extra bounce of reflection.

It also proivide option to trace the reflection in half scale (0.25 scale has aliasing issue, I should fix it in the future)

In Unity 6, I also make it support render graph API.
So the shader can run either on compatible mode or the new render graph.
With render graph enable, we can also use the STP (Spatial-Temporal Postprocessing) to downscale the native render scale. This way it imporve performance by a lot.
